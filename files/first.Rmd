Create a numeric vector containing the numbers 2.23, 3.45, 1.87, 2.11, 7.33, 18.34, 19.23. What is the average of these numbers?

```{r}
a <- c(2.23, 3.45, 1.87, 2.11, 7.33, 18.34, 19.23)
mean(a)
```

Use a for loop to determine the value of $\sum_{i=1}^{25} i^2$

```{r}
sum <- 0
for(i in 1:25)
  sum <- sum + i^2
sum
```

The cars dataset is available in base R. You can type cars to see it. Use the class function to determine what type of object is cars.
```{r}
class(cars)
```

How many rows does the cars object have?
```{r}
nrow(cars)
```

What is the name of the second column of cars?
```{r}
names(cars)[2]
```

The simplest way to extract the columns of a matrix or data.frame is using [. For example you can access the second column with cars[,2]. What is the average distance traveled in this dataset?
```{r}
mean(cars[,2])
```

Familiarize yourself with the which function. What row of cars has a a distance of 85?
```{r}
which(cars[,2]==85)
```
